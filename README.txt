GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data and patching:
-----------------------

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version.

Note that Doom 3 BFG Edition is available from the Steam store at
http://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/


Compiling on win32:
-------------------

A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 is provided in neo\doom3.sln
We expect the solution file is compatible with the Express releases

You will need the Microsoft DirectX SDK installed as well.
If it does not reside in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)"
you will need to update the project files accordingly.

Compiling on BlackBerry 10:
---------------------------

Make sure that Momentics 10.2 or higher is installed. Only works on the BlackBerry Z30
right now since it has OpenGL ES 3.0 support.

A set of projects are located within the blackberry folder. Import these projects and
compile doom3bfg.

## Data:
Currently, in order to get to run, images and shaders must be modified to convert
to a format that OpenGL ES 3.0 can handle.

Steps for now (as of last change to this file):
- Convert shaders to HLSL, so OpenGL ES version of project can convert them to a GLSL ES
    compatible version of GLSL. Do this by using Win32 project, and calling
    idRenderProgManager::SaveCGShader to convert the shader from its current GLSL format 
    to "Cg" (which looks more like a bastardized HLSL/Cg hybrid).
- Convert all DXT textures to ETC format. This can be done using either the built in
    conversion (which is very slow and doesn't cache the files by default) or to write
    an offline conversion program to convert each texture from it's generated format (bimage)
    to a normal texture, then compress it, then convert it back into it's generated format.
- Rebuild all resource files unless you are willing to take an IO performance hit from each
    file being open, read, and closed during execution compared to opening a resource file
    once, parsing it's metadata, and it never getting touched again until level load time 
    where it will only be read.


Steam:
------
The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality for integrating with 
Steam.  This includes roaming profiles, achievements, leaderboards, matchmaking, the overlay, or
any other Steam features.


Bink:
-----

The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality for rendering Bink Videos.


Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows:
--------------------------------------

The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as "Carmack's Reverse".


Other platforms, updated source code, security issues:
------------------------------------------------------

If you have obtained this source code several weeks after the time of release,
it is likely that you can find modified and improved versions of the engine in
various open source projects across the internet.

Depending what is your interest with the source code, those may be a better starting point.

    Already written OpenAL implementation
    POSIX Sys_ListFiles
    Proof that extern inline works in C++, which otherwise was "not really supported" (so the internet says)
    A working project to use as a reference if a portion of Doom 3 BFG for BlackBerry fails to work/compile

conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
